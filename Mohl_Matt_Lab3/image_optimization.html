	<h1>Optimizing Images</h1>

	<h2>Self Portrait (JPG)</h2>

	<img src="images/Mohl_Matt_SelfPortrait.jpg" alt="Matt Mohl: Self Portrait" width="504" height="792" title="Mohl_Matt_SelfPortrait.jpg" />

	<p>I worked on this in DCG as one of the projects. I chose this one because it is the only evidence of me having any ability to draw in existence today.</p>

	<h2>Gradient Circle (PNG-24)</h2>

	<img src="images/gradient.png" alt="A circular, green gradient" width="400" height="400" title="gradient.png"/>

	<p>I made this in this class. It's an extremely simple gradient where the alpha decreases from the center.</p>

	<h2>Random Badge Thing (GIF)</h2>

	<img src="images/gif_main.gif" alt="A badge of some sort" width="400" height="400" title="gif_main.gif" />

	<p>I made this in WDF as well. It is a very simple gif using 3 colors. This made it very easy to optimize it with the 4 color option.</p>
