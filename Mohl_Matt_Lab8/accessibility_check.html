	<h1>Accessibility Check</h1>

	<h2>Google</h2>

	<p>Google failed the Section 508 check as well as the AChecker check. Some of the errors they generated were due to img's with missing alt attributes in the AChecker. They could fix this easily by adding alt text to all img's. On the section 508, they did very well except they have an IFRAME without content. I have no idea what an IFRAME is so I can't offer them any advice on how to fix it. I assume they should put content into it.</p>

	<h2>Facebook</h2>

	<p>Facebook failed Section 508 and AChecker validation. On the Section 508 validation, they incurred errors with not putting labels on their form labels. As for the AChecker, it suggested for Facebook to use em or strong instead of where they used i elements. Other than that, Facebook is fairly accessible.</p>

	<h2>Twitter</h2>

	<p>Twitter failed their AChecker validation and couldn't even get through the Section 508 validation, so I'll treat that as a failure. On the AChecker, they simply were neglecting to use labels in form setup as well as using b and i as opposed to em and strong. Easy fixes. As for the Section 508, I cannot give them any advice on how to fix their problems as they couldn't get through the Cynthia Says validation.</p>

	<h2>Wells Fargo</h2>

	<p>Wells Fargo's website passed both the AChecker and Section 508 validation! Very impressive!</p>
