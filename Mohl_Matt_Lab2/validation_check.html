	<h1>Validation Check</h1>
	
	<h2>Google.com</h2>
	
	<p>Google.com did not validate for HTML 2.1. The homepage generated about 29
	errors, most of them caused by use of obsolete attributes such as border,
	cellpadding, and bgcolor. They could fix this by actually using CSS to style
	their content, instead of outdated HTML attributes.</p>
	
	<h2>YouTube.com</h2>
	
	<p>YouTube.com did not validate for HTML 2.1, generating 84 errors. I
	couldn't understand any specific errors, but from what I saw, the main cause
	was use of HTML for styling as opposed to CSS.</p>
	
	<h2>Twitter.com</h2>
	
	<p>Twitter.com was extremely close to validating as HTML 2.1, but fell two
	errors short. I can't for the life of me figure out what they mean, so I'm 
	pretty sure they are validator errors.</p>
	
	<h2>stumbleupon.com</h2>
	
	<p>stumbleupon.com also came close to validating as HTML 2.1. They ended up
	with 11 errors, however, most of them generating because they neglected to
	include alt attributes inside their img elements.</p>
