		cageapp.com is an app for designers, development teams, and companies that makes it easier to communicate and assign tasks without having millions of meetings. When putting their homepage into the HTML outliner, it returned a very well populated hierarchy of sections. The homepage has six separate sections with 2 of them having 5 sub-sections each. The only error I could find on the entire outline was the top section is untitled for whatever reason.

		webloyto.com seems to be a news site for web designers and developers alike. It is very clean and incorporates many sections in their box design. When fed into the outliner, however, it was clear that they hadn't used the sections correctly, as almost all of them were untitled. After looking at their source code I noticed the reason for this was because of their use of classes, not IDs to label sections.

	<article>
		brackets.io is the site for a text editor made for web development. It uses sort of a bread crumbs approach for a page flow, so when put into the outliner, there weren't that many sub-sections. I would expect this since they are trying to steer the viewer and not make them read. Other than having almost no subsections, the page is fine except for a couple untitled sections.

	<h2 id="wda">webdesignacademy.co.za</h2>

	<article>
		webdesignacademy.co.za is the homepage of the Web Design Academy. Since it's a school for web design, you would think it had titled sections with like subsections, but you'd be wrong. The outliner results showed the homepage has about 6 untitled sections. It's not a complete disaster though. They did well with the hierarchical nature of the sections, they just should have cleaned up all of their untitled sections.
